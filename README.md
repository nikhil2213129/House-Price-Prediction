# House Price Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors. Using machine learning techniques, we develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house.

## Introduction
This project uses historical data to predict house prices. The goal is to develop a model that can help individuals and businesses estimate the price of homes in different regions based on a set of features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features like:
- `LotArea`: Size of the lot
- `YearBuilt`: Year the house was built
- `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area square feet
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square feet of basement area
- `GarageArea`: Size of the garage in square feet
- `SalePrice`: Final sale price of the house (target variable)

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) or any relevant source.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

##Modeling Approach
The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize/scale the data, and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize correlations between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or select important features.
Model Selection: Train and evaluate different machine learning models, such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE, R-squared, and cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models.
